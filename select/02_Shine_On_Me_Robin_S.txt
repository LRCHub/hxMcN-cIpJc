I want to thank You, heavenly Father, for shining Your light on me,
You sent me someone who really loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee
I know it wouldn't have happen, without Your love,
Ooh, without Your love.

I want to thank You, heavenly Father, for shining Your light on me,
You sent me someone who really loves me, and not just my body,
He keeps me happy, so very happy and loves me,

I don't know how to be,
It's been a long time since I've had someone who loves me,

I owe my thanks to Thee

I know it wouldn't have happen, without You
Ooh, without Your love.

It took a long time for it to happen, but I knew those nights I prayed
That You would sent me someone who's real, and not someone for play,
I kept the faith and didn't worry, my nights grew longer than the days,
Until the day it really happened

You sent true love my way

And I know it wouldn't have happen, without Your love,
Ooh, without Your love.
I know it didn't happened, without Your Love

When the time is right, he'll fill Your life without a care,
Believe, and He'll be there,
Just do all right, don't do no wrong just keep the faith,
The Lord will shine his light your way.
Thank you Father, for shining Your light on me,

I prayed a long time for it to happen, I did 'cause I believed,
He makes me happy, so very happy, I don't know how to be,
It's been a long time, since I've had someone who loves me,
I owe my thanks to Thee (all my thanks to Thee)

I know it couldn't have happen, without You (without Your love),
Ooh, without Your love.
My nights were long and blue
Until He sent me you ooh, without You.
You showed me love, You showed me love.
