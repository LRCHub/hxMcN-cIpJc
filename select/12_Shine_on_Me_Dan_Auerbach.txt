You only got a couple miles to go
If you're trying to drive me insane
I saw you crack a smile about a week ago
In the middle of the pouring rain

I climb the cliffs of Dover to go drive out in the sun
I'm like a four leaf clover cause I hide from everyone

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

When I get up I gotta get me a plan
To do whatever I can I suppose
I'm already working for my uncle sam
You know he's got me counting Cheerios
Crying on my shoulder, I'm allergic to the tears
Trying for the solider to pretend for all these years

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Gotta keep my Ray-Bans on so my eyes won't burn
If I can shed no light upon my number one concern

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
