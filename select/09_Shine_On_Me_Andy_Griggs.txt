You changed my life you saved my soul
You let your sweet love shine on me
I found my strength when I lost control
You let your sweet love shine on me
Reflections of the pain and fear
Are closer than they may appear
Almost gone and almost here

Hey let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me hey

Even when the skies are gray
You let your sweet love shine on me
You find a way to find a way
To let your sweet love shine on me
You know I've built those walls
And sang the blues
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you

Hey let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me hey

You know I've built those walls and sang the blues
Over what this world is coming to
But walls are not enough for stopping you

Hey let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
Let your sweet, sweet love shine love shine down on me
